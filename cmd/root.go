	Short: "A simple bash history manager.",
	Long: `A simple bash history manager to supplement the bash history command.
	Initial implemenation included commands for showing the file size, the number of
	unique entries, the number of duplicate entries, and more. 
	
	For example:

 	hist-man size  		// shows the number of lines in the history file
	hist-man show -u  	// shows the unique entries in the history file`,
	// Uncomment the following line if your bare application
	// has an action associated with it:
	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { },
}

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
func Execute() {
	err := rootCmd.Execute()
	if err != nil {
		os.Exit(1)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.
	// Cobra supports persistent flags, which, if defined here,
	// will be global for your application.

	// rootCmd.PersistentFlags().StringVar(&cfgFile, "config", "", "config file (default is $HOME/.hist-man.yaml)")

	// Cobra also supports local flags, which will only run
	// when this action is called directly.
	rootCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
